# Video-2-Vocab

Our goal is to provide an easy way to learn a new language by creating vocabulary flashcards from a video in a foreign language. Our web app will order new words by difficulty and even give timestamps for you to hear how they use them in the video itself.

`git checkout dev` so that you're working on the developer branch 

Run `npm run start:dev` to start the local server to begin development
